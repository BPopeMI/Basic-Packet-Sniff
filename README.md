# Packet-Sniff - 2 Versions Tool simply analyzes network traffic. Was made for a college project - Had to make my own tools to be used during a security & network project.

#1. Packets.py collects and oraganizes it into a table located in "output.html" on your desktop. -Laggy when filtering

#2. SqlPacket.py writes to SQL database. Use any SQLite viewer to access database content. 
#2.A Using nodeJS script you can turn the SQL database back into an html document format to view the information - Kinda worthless as its the exact same as version 1, has the same lag problems.
